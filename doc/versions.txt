NetXMS Versioning Scheme

1.x

major.minor.release


2.x onward

* Product version

major.minor-qualifier	for pre-release

qualifier denotes release type:
	Mn		development milestone (like M3)
	RCn		release candidate (like RC1)
	no suffix	stable release
	Pn		patch release (like P1)

so first 2.x version is 2.0-M1 and first release version is 2.0 and first patch release is 2.0-P1

	101 .. 199	release candidate (101 = RC1, etc.)
	200		release
	301 ..		patch release (301 = P1, etc.)
