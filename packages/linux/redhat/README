Run `package.sh -ver version` to build the packages.

The script will look for the archive named netxms-"version".tar.gz in the 
script's directory. If the archive isn't found, it'll be downloaded from
http://www.netxms.org/download/archive/ (if it exists).

RPM packages will be stored in the "rpms" directory.
